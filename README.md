## Interests

💡 I build low-level embedded systems that interact with the real world — especially where radar, vision and real-time constraints meet.

🔧 My focus is on firmware development, low-latency sensor fusion and perception pipelines for robotics and intelligent embedded devices.

🚀 My mission is to stay sharp, build with purpose and contribute to high-impact systems.
